## New Functionality

### NSFW Model

The 'Not Safe For Work' model analyzes images and videos and returns probability scores on the likelihood 
that the image or video contains pornography.

### Color 

The color endpoint is used to retrieve the dominant colors present in your images or videos. Color values are 
returned in the hex format. A density value is also returned to let you know how much of the color is 
present. In addition, colors are also mapped to their closest W3C counterparts.
